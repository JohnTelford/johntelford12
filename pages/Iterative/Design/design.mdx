## Responsive Web Design

The majority of website are accessed by users using mobile devices. They have little tolerance for slow loading web pages or pages that do not conform to their screen size.

Website designs must ensure pages load quickly and adjust from minimum to maximum display size to ensure usability. Web pages must display correctly on a variety of devices and window or screen sizes from minimum to maximum display size, and the website look and feel, users experience, and functionality must maintain consistency.


### Consistency

Website consistency is the look and feel of the site.  The users experience, and functionality does not vary between web pages.

### Theme

The theme is the website is Color Scheme, Typology, Navigation, and User Interface.

	- Header
	- Web page
	- Fonts
	- Footer

	CSS is the traditional software for designing web site themes.  Maybe a better way to build and maintain a theme for the lifetime of the website is to use [Tailwindcss Utility CSS Classes](https://tailwindcss.com) and avoid the difficulties maintaining CSS semantic class names.  
  
	TailwindCSS removes the default browser styling from paragraphs, headings, lists and more, and replaces them with Utility classes. This is useful for building website themes because less time is spent with the ever growing number of CSS semantic class names created during Design, Development and Maintenance. 
	
	Typography [Tailwindcss Typography](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss-typography) is the style and appearance of web page matter. It provides a set of prose classes. A single style statement using them can add typographic defaults to all web pages for website consistency look and feel.
	
	Other style statements using `prose` classes may be used within a MDX page to style most anything.

	This style statement is automatically applied to all web pages when they are rendered.
	
	`<article className="prose prose-xl max-w-none  text-gray-600"></article>`

The [Tailwindcss Typography](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss-typography) page and the [Tailwind Components Cheatsheet](https://tailwindcomponents.com/cheatsheet/) tells us the `prose` utilities are

- `lg	max-width: 1024px;` 
- `max-w-none:	max-width: none;`
- text-gray-600
