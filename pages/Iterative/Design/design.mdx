Website consistency is the look and feel of the site.  The users experience, and functionality does not vary between web pages.

#### Theme

- Color scheme  
	- Header
	- Web page
	- Fonts
	- Footer





- Navigation



- User interaction


- Tools  
	CSS is the traditional software for designing web site themes.  A better way to maintain a theme for the lifetime of the website may be to use [Tailwindcss Utility CSS Classes](https://tailwindcss.com) and avoid the difficulties maintaining CSS semantic class names.  
  
	TailwindCSS removes the default browser styling from paragraphs, headings, lists and more, and replaces them with Utility classes This is useful for building website themes because less time is spent with the ever growing number of CSS semantic class names during development and maintenance. 
	
- Typography  
	[Tailwindcss Typography](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss-typography) is the style and appearance of web page matter. 

	This plugin provides a set of prose classes. A single style statement using these classes can add typographic defaults to all HTML rendered from MDX files for website consistency look and feel.
	
	Other style statements using prose classes may be used within a MDX page to style most anything.
