## Responsive Web Design

The majority of website are accessed by users using mobile devices. They have little tollarance for slow loading web pages or pages that do not conform to their screen size.

Website designs must ensure pages load quickly and adjust from minimum to maximum display size to ensure usability. Web pages must display correctly on a variety of devices and window or screen sizes from minimum to maximum display size, and the website look and feel, users experience, and functionality must maintain consistency.

## Web Components
 
This site is built using web components :

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) is for building user interfaces (UIs)
	
	It is an open-source, front end, [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript) library created by Facebook. 

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) is a React framework.  It is an abstraction of React omitting unimportant details and exposing the React interface.

- [MDX](https://mdxjs.com) is Markdown built for the component age by Facebook. It has identical syntax as Markdown. MDX is an author-able format that enables seamlessly writing JSX in Markdown documents. You can import React components such as interactive charts or alerts or other components built with JSX and other React components.
