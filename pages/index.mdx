## Iterative Development

### [Define](Iterative/Define/define)

Defining website results contribute to *Develop*


## [Design](Iterative/Design/design)

Website *Design* creates the look and feel *Develop* builds 


## [Develop](Iterative/Develop/develop)

Developing websites is akin to translating *Define* and *Design* into abstract logical structures using rigid nonhuman languages, and a variety of tools. The slightest errors or security issues will require remediations during the life time of the website.


## [Deploy](Iterative/Deploy/deploy)

Deploying a website is making it available on the Internet. The production version is deployed when stakeholders agree. Meanwhile, developers working on features, fixes, or testing may deploy private website with their changes, without disturbing other developers work or the production version. This enables the stakeholders to monitor progress.


 ### [Maintain](Iterative/Maintain/maintain)

Maintain is remediating *Define*, *Design*,*Develop*, *Deploy*, or Security problems.
