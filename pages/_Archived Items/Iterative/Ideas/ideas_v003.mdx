## Importance of Web Design

[The Importance of Web Design](https://readwrite.com/2021/10/06/the-importance-of-web-design/)

Taut web designing can never be achieved until you are fully aware of what needs to be done. Likewise, design can never achieve greatness until it is perfectly complemented by content. Design can influence the minds of the visitors of any website, but if done with the conjunction of apt content, it can be the icing on the cake.

Content is perhaps the most important aspect that is ignored by businesses. However, there are certainly some aspects that are truly required to make the design work. For example, description of the products can only be done through content as most people may not be aware of the features of a product. Thus, it would be best to look for something that makes users think of the website exceptionally well to make a great impression. So, of course, the first point of action is to have a great design that makes people remember your business.

Never think of the content that can’t work in your favor. Content is the basis of any website, so that it can work for it regardless of the design. But when the design can complement the content perfectly, the result is a website that can be marvelous, to say the least. But what else can work for a website so that it can get the attention of its visitors in the first few seconds?

[Can We Use Python to Create a Successful MVP?](https://www.techopedia.com/can-we-use-python-to-create-a-successful-mvp/2/34614)

Building a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) is the easiest way to understand whether a product idea will work or not.

What is an MVP (Minimum Viable Product)?

A minimum viable product (MVP) is a product with enough features to test with the end-users. It is used to get feedback from a group of people about the positive aspects and shortcomings.

An MVP in web development is also known as the prototype or the first release of the product. It attracts early adopters and is the best way to validate a product idea.

Existing companies can test an MVP for new products, while startups can create a prototype for their new business idea.

[Diving Into Dev: The Software Development Life Cycle](https://www.techopedia.com/6/33681/diving-into-dev-the-software-development-life-cycle)

## Phases of the Software Development Life Cycle

At its most basic level, the software development life cycle is composed of a number of phases.

The five core phases of SDLC involve requirements analysis, design, development, testing and maintenance. Some experts add a sixth phase called deployment, or even a seventh phase, but the five core phases give a general idea of what's involved.

Each phase has its own requirements and deliverables that need to progress to the next phase.

The first phase is requirement gathering and analysis. This is the phase in which brainstorming happens to determine how a product will be used and what role it needs to play. This is also where teams get buy-in for a project.

The second phase is design – here the teams start putting effort into drawing the broader contours of the software product itself. They look at hardware specifications and how a piece of software will fit into a system architecture.

Implementation or coding is the next phase, which is the practical writing phase, and tends to be the most involved phase of the process, although design and testing are other candidates.

After that comes testing, another core phase that debugs and fine tunes the codebase.

The deployment phase involves getting a software product out to its intended user base.

The last phase, maintenance, addresses the production environment and what happens when the software is out in the world being used by end users. The ongoing professional guidance that the software product receives is the core maintenance that makes up this last phase.

Done right, these phases can optimize how a software project gets done.

“The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is the software development world’s spellcheck,” writes Robert Half. “It can flag errors in software creation before they’re discovered (at a much higher cost) in successive stages. But it’s much more than that, of course: SDLC can also lay out a plan for getting everything right the first time.”

However, the linear stages that software projects go through also benefit from higher-level frameworks or models that direct them. In the next page, we’ll talk about some of these models and how they work.

## SDLC Models

The core phases of the software development life cycle are managed by a number of models which are considered common in the software industry. As we'll see later, many of these are in flux and changing due to changes in the industry, but they are often taught as traditional SDLC models.

One that is often mentioned first is the “waterfall” method or “cascade” method. This is named like it is because each step “falls” into the step after it. A visual will often show a line or box with an arrow going down into a subsequent line or box at the next level.

In the waterfall model, each phase is clearly delineated and separate. All of the requirements gathering is done before any design takes place, and all of the design is completed before codebase writing, and all of the codebase writing is done before testing, etc. This provides a very concrete structure for the project: Everyone always knows which phase the project is in, and works accordingly. However, the waterfall model also has its down side, where the process is not as versatile due to the solid barriers between phases.

## Iterative or Incremental

[Iterative and incremental development](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Iterative_and_incremental_development) Good **Wikipedia** read. Compares Iterative with Waterfall

Another mode is the “iterative” model or “incremental” model.

The incremental model is something you might call a “fragmented” or “fractal” model, in contrast to the waterfall model. Here, the individual steps are broken up into micro components – instead of one overarching design phase, there are multiple design phases locked together with other key tasks from other phases like coding, implementation and testing.

One way to understand the incremental approach is to look at different types of testing – for example, there’s unit testing. A unit is the smallest testable part of any software. Testing software with a unit testing approach means that the small modules are treated differently and independently of one another. Unit testing provides that incremental model, as it allows programmers to test each module or part of the codebase individually and with a granular approach

Another common SDLC model, the “V-shaped” model, has a similar structure, but a somewhat different workflow aspect, where the initial phases go down into implementation and testing phases, and where multiple testing phases follow.

Then there's the agile model which emerged in the last decade or so, bringing us into new philosophies of software design. Incremental development plays a role, and the process itself becomes more complex as key tasks get shuffled from one phase to the other.

## What Is an Abstraction?

[Why Your Code Needs Abstraction Layers](https://thenewstack.io/why-your-code-needs-abstraction-layers/)

Good abstractions reduce complexity and allow developers to make changes to the code with more ease and fewer bugs. But creating abstractions isn’t easy. So how exactly do you do this, and what steps do you need to take?


Before talking about abstraction layers in code, let’s briefly talk about abstractions in general and what they are.

Abstraction can be defined as the process of simplifying an entity by:

Omitting unimportant details.
Exposing an interface.
All abstractions are similar in that regard.
