## Overview

Creating websites that meet users needs are difficult, complex, time consuming, and expensive.


## Content

People visit websites for the content. Most access the website using mobile devices. They have little tolerance for slow loading web pages or pages that do not conform to their screen size. The website look and feel, users experience, functionality, need to be consistence and complement the content.

## Cost

The purpose of a website is to deliver content. Users have little concern how a webpage was created, deployed to the Internet, or how it got to their screen.

This website is about optimizing website project life time costs. It describes a  framework for building and deploying websites. It is based on using Iterative Development and web component technology.

Iterative website development enables the Define, Design, Develop, Deploy and Maintain processes to be operational and to discover defects, at the same time. 

A key technology is a central online web hosted project repository for all project files. It is a unified source of truth. It helps teams collaborate and maintain the entire history of project file changes. Developers can view history of changes and go back to a previous version. It also helps answer the questions _who changed what, where, when, and why?_

The central project repository enables all team members to have their own local copy of it. They can make changes, fix defects, add new features to their copy of the project repository, without interfering with others, or the central project repository. Team members may deploy their copy of the project repository with their changes to a private website enabling all stakeholders to see and give feedback.

When stakeholders determine repository changes, defects or new features are ready, they will be updated in the central project repository, and team members can update their own local copy of the repository.

Some times companies may have little interest in how their websites are constructed, as long as they have the features and functionality needed to satisfy their users. The cost of error and security remediation, may cost a magnitude or more money than creating the websites.

## Defect Remediation Costs

Most content and software defects cost less when found early, as this chart shows:

Some of the early error detection mechanisms built into the framework used to build this website are:

- Automatic tools in the editor that continuly check for syntax and other errors 
- Fast refresh live-editing quickly show runtime errors
- Team members may deploy their copy of the project repository with their changes to a private website enabling all stakeholders to see and give feedback.

## Minimum Viable Product 

 A Minimum Viable Product is a way to understand whether a product idea will work or not. It is a stage in product development with the *must* features to test with the end-users. It is used to get feedback from a group of people about the positive aspects and shortcomings.
 
 The next steps are to adding the *want* features in the process, until the stakeholders agree that the website is at Version 1 and ready to be released to the Internet.
